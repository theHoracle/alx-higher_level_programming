**PYTHON'S INHERITANCE**
nheritance is a way to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class is called the subclass, and the existing class is the superclass.

The subclass can inherit attributes and behaviors from the superclass, and can also have additional attributes and behaviors of its own. This allows you to create a new class that is a specialized version of an existing class, without having to rewrite all of the code in the new class.

In Python, a subclass is created by defining a new class that includes the name of the superclass in parentheses as part of the class definition. The subclass can then override or extend the attributes and behaviors of the superclass by defining new methods or attributes, or by modifying the methods and attributes inherited from the superclass.

For example:
```
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.breed = breed
        super().__init__(name, species="Dog")
```

In this example, the Dog class is a subclass of the Animal class. It inherits the name and species attributes from the Animal class, and it also has a new attribute, breed, that is specific to the Dog class. The Dog class also has an __init__ method that overrides the __init__ method of the Animal class, and calls the __init__ method of the Animal class using the super() function to set the name and species attributes.
