Python's sets and dictionaries are two powerful data structures that are commonly used in computer programming.


**SETS**
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is often used to store and manipulate data in an efficient and flexible manner. Sets are particularly useful for applications that require the ability to quickly check if an element is present in the set, or to compute the intersection or difference between two sets.

In Python, a set can be created using the set() function. Here is an example of how to create and manipulate a set in Python:

```
# Create an empty set
my_set = set()

# Add some elements to the set
my_set.add(1)
my_set.add(2)
my_set.add(3)

# Print the set
print(my_set)

# Check if an element is in the set
print(1 in my_set)
print(4 in my_set)

# Compute the intersection of two sets
other_set = set([3, 4, 5])
print(my_set.intersection(other_set))

# Compute the difference between two sets
print(my_set.difference(other_set))
```
This code would print the following output:
```
{1, 2, 3}
True
False
{3}
{1, 2}

```

**DICTIONARY**
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. It is often used to store and manipulate data in an efficient and flexible manner. Dictionaries are particularly useful for applications that require the ability to quickly retrieve or update the value associated with a specific key.

In Python, a dictionary can be created using the dict() function. Here is an example of how to create and manipulate a dictionary
