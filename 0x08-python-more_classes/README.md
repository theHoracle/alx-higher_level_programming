*CLASS IN PYTHON*
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors that the objects will have.
To create a class, you use the class keyword followed by the name of the class. The class definition should include a __init__ method, which is called when an instance of the class is created. The __init__ method is used to initialize the attributes of the instance.
To create an instance of a class, you call the class like a function and assign the result to a variable.
You can define class attributes, which are attributes that are shared by all instances of the class, and instance attributes, which are attributes that are specific to a single instance of the class.
You can define instance methods, which are methods that are called on an instance of the class and have access to the instance attributes. You can also define class methods, which are methods that are called on the class itself and have access to the class attributes.
You can use inheritance to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class is called a subclass, and the existing class is the superclass. The subclass inherits the attributes and behaviors of the superclass and can override or extend them.
Here is an example of a simple Python class:

```
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print('Woof!')

dog = Dog('Fido', 'Labrador')
print(dog.name)  # Output: 'Fido'
print(dog.breed)  # Output: 'Labrador'
dog.bark()  # Output: 'Woof!'
```

This Dog class has a __init__ method that is called when an instance of the class is created, and an instance method bark that prints a message. It also has two instance attributes name and breed, which are set when the instance is created.

You can then create an instance of the Dog class and call its methods like this

```
dog = Dog('Fido', 'Labrador')
print(dog.name)  # Output: 'Fido'
print(dog.breed)  # Output: 'Labrador'
dog.bark()  # Output: 'Woof!'
```
