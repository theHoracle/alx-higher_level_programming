*Testing functions in Python*
This directory contains the test suite for Project X, a software library for performing advanced mathematical calculations. The test suite is written in Python and uses the unittest framework.

*Running the Tests
To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```
python -m unittest discover
```
This will discover and run all the tests in the tests directory. You can also specify a particular test file or test case to run by using the -s and -t options, respectively.

Writing Tests
To write a new test, create a new Python file in the tests directory and define a subclass of unittest.TestCase. Define any test methods in the subclass, using the naming convention test_*. You can also use various assert methods provided by unittest.TestCase to verify the correctness of your code.

Here is an example of a simple test case:

```
import unittest
from projectx import ComplexNumber

class TestComplexNumber(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        c1 = ComplexNumber(1, 2)
        c2 = ComplexNumber(3, 4)
        c3 = c1 + c2
        self.assertEqual(c3.real, 4)
        self.assertEqual(c3.imag, 6)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
For more information on writing and running tests with unittest, refer to the unittest documentation.
